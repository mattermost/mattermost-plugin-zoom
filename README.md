# mattermost-plugin-zoom [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-zoom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-zoom)

This plugin will add UI for users to start new Zoom meetings in a Mattermost channel. Posts are created when a meeting starts and edited when a meeting ends.

## Installation

Go to the [releases page of this Github repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-zoom/releases) and download the latest release for your server architecture. You can upload this file in the Mattermost system console to install the plugin.

## Developing

This plugin contains both a server and web app portion.

Use `make dist` to build distributions of the plugin that you can upload to a Mattermost server for testing.

Use `make check-style` to check the style for the whole plugin.

### Server

Inside the `/server` directory, you will find the Go files that make up the server-side of the plugin. Within there, build the plugin like you would any other Go application.

### Web App

Inside the `/webapp` directory, you will find the JS and React files that make up the client-side of the plugin. Within there, modify files and components as necessary. Test your syntax by running `npm run build`.
