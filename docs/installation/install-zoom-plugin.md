# Install Zoom Plugin

### Install via Plugin Marketplace \(Recommended\)

1. Go to **Main Menu &gt; Plugin Marketplace** in Mattermost
2. Search for "Zoom" or manually find the plugin from the list and click **Install**
3. After the plugin has downloaded and been installed, follow the instructions on [Zoom Configuration](zoom-configuration/)
4. After finishing the [Zoom Configuration](zoom-configuration/), follow the instructions on [Mattermost Setup](mattermost-setup.md)

### \(Alternative\) Install via Manual Upload

If your server doesn't have access to the internet, you can download the [latest plugin binary release](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-zoom/releases) and upload it to your server via **System Console &gt; Plugin Management.** The binary releases on the page above, are the same as used by the Marketplace.
