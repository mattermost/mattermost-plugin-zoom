# Zoom Setup \(JWT\)

We are going to set the **API Key** and **API Secret**, generated by Zoom and used to create meetings and pull user data:

* Go to [https://marketplace.zoom.us](https://marketplace.zoom.us) and log in.

## Create an App for Mattermost to connect with

* In the top left click on **Develop** and then **Build App**.
* Select **JWT** in **Choose your app type** section
* Enter a name for your app

## Configure your new JWT app to work with Mattermost

* Click Information
* Enter the **Company Name** and **Developer Contact Information** for your app.
* Click App Credentials
* Here you'll find your **API Key** and **API Secret**.
  * These need to be copied and pasted into the Zoom Plugin configuration screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
Users will need to sign-up for their own Zoom account using the same email address that they use for Mattermost. If the user attempts to start a Zoom meeting without a Zoom account, they will see the following error message: "We could not verify your Mattermost account in Zoom. Please ensure that your Mattermost email address matches your Zoom email address." In addition, the user must be added to the admin's Zoom account to quickly start a meeting.
{% endhint %}

## Finish Setting up Mattermost Server

* Follow the instructions for [Mattermost Setup](../mattermost-setup.md)
