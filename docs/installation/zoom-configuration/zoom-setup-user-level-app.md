# Zoom Setup \(User Level App\)



You can set the **OAuth ClientID** and **OAuth Secret**, generated by Zoom, and use it to create meetings and pull user data.

**User-level Apps** require **each user** to authorize the Mattermost App to access their Zoom account individually.  If you prefer to authorize it's access by an admin on behalf of the whole Zoom organization you should create a [Zoom Account-Level App](zoom-setup-oauth.md).  

## Create an App for Mattermost

* Go to [https://marketplace.zoom.us/](https://marketplace.zoom.us/) and log in as an admin.
* In the top left click on **Develop** and then **Build App**.
* Select **OAuth** in **Choose your app type** section.
* Enter a name for your app.
* Choose **User-managed app** as the app type.
* Choose whether you **Would like to publish this app on Zoom Marketplace**. In most cases you'll want this to be disabled, but the plugin support also apps to be published in the Zoom Marketplace.
* Click **Create**.

## Configure Your New OAuth App to Work with Mattermost

* If you **would like to publish on Zoom Marketplace**, you will find two sets of values: **development** and **production**. Make sure you follow the next steps with the production values.
* Go to the **App Credentials** tab on the left. Here you'll find your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
  * These will be needed during [Mattermost Setup]().
* Enter a Valid **Redirect URL for OAuth** \(`https://SITEURL/plugins/zoom/oauth2/complete`\) and add the same URL under **Whitelist URL**.
  * `SITEURL` should be your Mattermost server URL.

* Add the following scopes: **meeting:read**, **user:read**.

## Do not perform the Install step

* Zoom has one last option called Install. There is no need to perform this action.
* If you perform this action, you will see an error on Mattermost. This is expected.

## Deauthorization

This plugin allows users to be deauthorized directly from Zoom, in order to comply with Zoom’s commitment to security and the protection of user data. If you **would like to publish on Zoom Marketplace**, you will be able to set up a Deauthorization URL.

* Click on **Information**.
* Near the end of the page, you will find a section called **Deauthorization Notification**.
* Enter a valid **Endpoint URL** \(`https://SITEURL/plugins/zoom/deauthorization?secret=WEBHOOKSECRET`\). 
  * `SITEURL` should be your Mattermost server URL.
  * `WEBHOOKSECRET` is generated during [Mattermost Setup]().
